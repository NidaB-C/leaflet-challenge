# Earthquake Data Visualization

## Overview
This project visualizes earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet, D3.js, and the CartoDB Positron tileset for a grayscale map aesthetic. It demonstrates the use of GeoJSON data to plot earthquake locations and magnitudes on a world map. Users can interact with the visualization by clicking on data points to reveal more information about each earthquake event.

## Features
- Interactive map with zoom and pan capabilities.
- Earthquake markers sized according to magnitude.
- Marker colors that represent the depth of the earthquakes.
- Popups that provide additional information about each earthquake event.
- A legend explaining the color scale in relation to the earthquake depths.
